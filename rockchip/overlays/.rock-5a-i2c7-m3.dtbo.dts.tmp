  description = "Enable I2C7-M3 and Disable onboard Audio Jack.
Onboard audio jack has to be disabled, as the codec is connected to I2C7 on different pins.
Once I2C signal is routed to 40-pin header, the codec is disconnected, thus unusable.
On Radxa ROCK 5A this is SDA pin 11 & SCL pin 13.
On Radxa ROCK 5C this is SDA pin 11 & SCL pin 13.
On Radxa ROCK 5D this is SDA pin 11 & SCL pin 13.
